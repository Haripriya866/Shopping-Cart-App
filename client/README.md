# Title
Shopping Cart App

## Objective
Create a simple React application that allows users to add products to a shopping cart, update quantities, and track their progress towards earning a free gift.

## Demo

Link: https://shopping-cart-app-alpha.vercel.app

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, Vite, Github, and vercel for hosting the repository.

### Functionality
* Display Products: 
    Use the given PRODUCTS constant to render a list of products.
    Each product should have a quantity selector with + and - buttons and an "Add to Cart" button.
* Shopping Cart:
    Display the cart below the products.
    Allow users to update product quantities in the cart.
    Allow users to remove products from the cart.
^ Free Gift Rule:
    If the cart subtotal reaches THRESHOLD (1000), add the FREE_GIFT product automatically.
    Show a progress bar above the cart indicating how much more needs to be added before the free gift is unlocked.
    Ensure only one free gift is added, and it cannot be removed manually.
    Make sure the cart gift item is removed if the cart value goes below the Threshold value
* State Management:
    Use Reactâ€™s built-in state management (useState, useEffect).
    Maintain separate states for products and cart.
* User Experience:
    Show a message when the free gift is added.
    Ensure smooth interactions for adding/removing items.
